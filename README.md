Personal blog task

Firstly, this task is just to practice main basics before going on advanced basics.

task consists of:
* Main page of articles for all articles.
* Register page and login using scaffold bootstrap ui. 
* Add new article page
* Edit articles page
* Delete article page


How it works 

* Register first and login to edit or delete or add ... you can see articles but cannot take any action on add or edit or delete without authentication
* Arabic or English language is just for check feature is working or not ... it needs to change database to work correctly AS to add Arabic language on database to work correct as to fetch articles with both languages ... language just work on new articles work on add article page ... home page not included in language pages 
* Images added on database with intervention image Package on edit page … added without package in add article page
* It was planned to make a page for every article by id but as I added buttons to edit  or delete  by id … no need to another page
